*** Find the two non-repeating elements in an array of repeating elements/ Unique Numbers 2 ***

Given an array in which all numbers except two are repeated once.
(i.e. we have 2n+2 numbers and n numbers are occurring twice and remaining two have occurred once).
Find those two numbers in the most efficient way.

Example 1:
    Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4}
    Output: 3 4

Example 2:
    Input: arr[] = {2, 1, 3, 2}
    Output: 1 3
